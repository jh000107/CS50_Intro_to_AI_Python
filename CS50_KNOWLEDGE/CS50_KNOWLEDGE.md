## Knowledge

**Knowledge-Based Agents**

These are agents that reason by operating on internal representations of knowledge.

what does "reasoning based on knowledge to draw a conclusion" mean?

Harry Potter example. Consider the following sentences:

1. If it didn't rain, Harry visited Hagrid today.
2. Harry visited Hagrid or Dumbledore today, but not both.
3. Harry visited Dumbledore today.

Based on these three sentences, using 2 and 3, we know that

4. Harry did not visit Hagrid.

Now looking at sentence 1, we can conclude that

5. It rained today.

To come to this conclusion, we used logic, and today's lecture explores how AI can use logic to reach to new conclusions based on existing information.
