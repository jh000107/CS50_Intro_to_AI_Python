1. **SEARCH:**
   - Finding a solution to a problem, like a navigator app that finds the best route from your origin to the destination, or like playing a game and figuring out the next move.
2. **KNOWLEDGE:**
   - Representing information and drawing inferences from it.
3. **OPTIMIZATION:**
   - Dealing with uncertain events using probability.
4. **LEARNING:**
   - Finding not only a correct way to solve a problem, but a better-or the best-way to solve it.
5. **NEURAL NETWORKS:**
   - A program structure inspired by the human brain that is able to perform tasks effectively.
6. **LANGUAGE:**
   - Processing natural language, which is produces and understood by humans.
